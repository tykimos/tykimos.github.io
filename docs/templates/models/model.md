# Model class API

In the functional API, given an input tensor and output tensor, you can instantiate a `Model` via:

```python
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

a = Input(shape=(32,))
b = Dense(32)(a)
model = Model(input=a, output=b)
```

This model will include all layers required in the computation of `b` given `a`.

In the case of multi-input or multi-output models, you can use lists as well:

```python
model = Model(input=[a1, a2], output=[b1, b3, b3])
```

For a detailed introduction of what `Model` can do, read [this guide to the Keras functional API](/getting-started/functional-api-guide).

## Useful attributes of Model

- `model.layers` is a flattened list of the layers comprising the model graph.
- `model.inputs` is the list of input tensors.
- `model.outputs` is the list of output tensors.
