## Prompt
Redefine the scene in a semi-realistic webtoon style, this time focusing on the woman as she's sprawled out on a comfortable floor cushion, surrounded by scattered research papers and books. Her intellectual journey takes a more relaxed yet equally focused form. She's dressed in casual, yet comfortable attire, suitable for a long session of reading and note-taking. Her golden blonde hair is loosely tied, reflecting a blend of comfort and concentration. With a highlighter in one hand and a research paper in the other, she's deeply absorbed in her study, occasionally jotting down notes or marking important passages. The warm mug of tea and the white cat, now curiously peering over some of the papers, add to the scene's warmth and homeliness. The large window in the background lets in the soft glow of the evening, illuminating her makeshift study space and highlighting the dedication in her quest for knowledge. This adaptation offers a glimpse into her more informal, yet passionately intellectual, engagement with her work.
