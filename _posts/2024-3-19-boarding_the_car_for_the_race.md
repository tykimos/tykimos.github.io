## Prompt
Revise the scene to capture the moment just before the celebrity puts on her blue and white helmet, seated in the vivid blue Formula car at the modern Korean racetrack. Her poise and elegance are highlighted as she prepares for the race, holding the helmet close to her head with both hands. Her long blonde hair flows freely around her shoulders, and her stylish reflective sunglasses are poised on her face, adding to her modern and edgy look. The 'Tyri' logo on her racing suit is prominently displayed, reinforcing her connection to the racing world. The background features the clear blue sky, enriching the race day atmosphere with a sense of anticipation and excitement. This image should be rendered in a vibrant, semi-realistic webtoon style, emphasizing the celebrity's graceful readiness inside the racing car, with the dynamic and colorful racing environment around her, maintaining the cohesive blue and white color theme.
