## Artwork Description

The sunlight streaming through the window softly and subtly illuminated the room, revealing a young girl with a passion for tarot. However, she was no ordinary girl. What made her shine wasn't merely the sunlight. It was her innate charm and elegance, captivating the hearts of those who encountered her.

The first thing that caught the eye was her skin, which glowed as if kissed by the morning sun. Her cheeks blushed with the red hue of youth and excitement, seemingly holding within them the mysterious tales of the universe. And then, her eyes - deep pools of sapphire reflecting wisdom and curiosity, surrounded by long lashes that danced like butterfly wings with every blink. Her high cheekbones and delicate rose-tinted lips further accentuated her beauty.

Her posture exuded a confidence and strength beyond her years, a testament to countless hours of practice and honing her craft. The blouse she wore was subtly adorned with tarot motifs, symbolizing her dedication and love for this mystical art. As the sunlight embraced her, one could almost feel the energy and magic radiating from her.

On her desk lay an array of meticulously arranged tarot cards, waiting for their secrets to be unveiled. With the precision and purpose gained from years of practice, she reached out to pick a card. The room seemed to hold its breath in anticipation of her revelation.

But for her, tarot was more than just predicting the future. It reflected life, its challenges, and celebrations. Through the cards, she connected with the universe, understanding its ups and downs, joys, and sorrows. And through her radiant smile, she conveyed that understanding and love to all who crossed her path.

The 'Tarot Girl' represented more than just her journey, her passion, and her everlasting love.

## Create a BIC image by expression

The evolving landscape of AI-powered image generation is awe-inspiring. One of the trailblazers in this domain, Bing Image Creator (DALL-E2), empowers users to craft visual artistry from textual prompts. But how do you tune your prompts to paint the perfect picture? Let’s dive deep into the intricate art of crafting prompts for DALL-E2.

### 1. The High-Resolution Realm

Prompt: *(4k Full body shot)*
The expectation here is simple: a crisp, high-definition image that captures a figure in its entirety. While the term “4k” emphasizes quality, ensure that "full body" is accentuated to avoid mere face shots or bust portraits. Similar expressions that resonate with this intent include "High-resolution full figure image" and "4k complete body view". A quick tip? Always prioritize clarity over complexity.

* Expected Image: A high-resolution image of a full figure.
* Similar Expressions: "High-resolution full figure image", "4k complete body view".
* Alternative Expressions: "HD portrait shot", "Ultra HD full body depiction".
* Considerations: Ensure that "full body" is emphasized to avoid getting just a portrait or bust shot.

### 2. Fantasy Meets Reality

Prompt: *(Semi-Realism fantasy depiction of a teenage girl who practices tarot with a beaming smile with a warm smile feminine posture)*
With this, the anticipation is a lifelike, albeit fantasy-skewed portrayal of a tarot-practicing teenager. The art lies in balancing vivid imagination with tangible reality. While "Fantasy-style teenage girl with tarot and a big smile" works similarly, a simpler "Artistic representation of a smiling girl with tarot cards" might suffice if the AI is overwhelmed with details.

* Expected Image: A lifelike but slightly exaggerated or fantastical portrayal of a young girl engaging with tarot cards, showing a bright, inviting smile and feminine stance.
* Similar Expressions: "Fantasy-style teenage girl with tarot and a big smile", "Semi-realistic girl practicing tarot with a cheerful demeanor".
* Alternative Expressions: "Fantasy depiction of a joyful tarot-reading teenager", "Artistic representation of a smiling girl with tarot cards".
* Considerations: The complexity might cause the AI to overlook some details. It's better to be concise or break the prompts.

### 3. In the Details of Beauty

Prompt: (bright and radiant skin with rosy cheeks, luminous sapphire eyes framed by long, fluttering lashes, perfectly sculpted high cheekbones, and lips with a gentle rose hue)
This prompt is a treasure trove of intricate details. The magic is in the blending of radiant skin, sparkling eyes, and the gentle hue of the lips. Although you might be tempted to cram in more details, remember: simplicity often crafts the most memorable portraits.

* Expected Image: A close-up showing glowing skin, blushed cheeks, sparkling blue eyes with long eyelashes, pronounced cheekbones, and soft pink lips.
* Similar Expressions: "Face with glowing skin, blue eyes, and rosy features", "Portrait with sapphire eyes, radiant complexion, and rose-tinted lips".
* Alternative Expressions: "Face with shimmering skin and prominent cheekbones", "Dazzling blue eyes with fluttery lashes and pinkish lips".
* Considerations: Avoid over-detailing to let the AI focus on primary features.

### 4. Subtlety in Motifs

Prompt: *(Blouse with subtle tarot motifs)*
In fashion, less is often more. This prompt seeks a blouse with nuanced tarot designs. The word "subtle" is key; it ensures the designs don't overshadow the garment's inherent beauty. "Shirt with mystical tarot imprints" is an alternative that might capture a similar essence.

Expected Image: A blouse decorated with discreet tarot card symbols or patterns.
Similar Expressions: "Shirt with light tarot designs", "Blouse with faint tarot card patterns".
Alternative Expressions: "Top with tarot-inspired graphics", "Shirt with mystical tarot imprints".
Considerations: Emphasize "subtle" to ensure the motifs don't overpower the design.

### 5. Sun-Kissed Illumination

Prompt: *(The sunlight streaming from the window bathes her face and subtly illuminates the curves of her upper body)*
Light plays a crucial role in visual compositions. This prompt crafts an aura where gentle sunlight bestows an ethereal glow upon the subject. The emphasis on the window as the light source ensures a specific shading effect, bringing depth to the image.

![img](http://tykimos.github.io/warehouse/2023-8-31-bic_tarot_girl_1_4_3.jpeg)

* Expected Image: An image where the girl's face and upper body are gently lit by sunlight coming through a window.
* Similar Expressions: "Sunlight from a window softly highlighting her face and torso", "Gentle sun rays from a window casting light on her upper body".
* Alternative Expressions: "Face and body illuminated by window's sunlight", "Girl basking in the window's gentle sun glow".
* Considerations: Ensure the source of light (window) is mentioned to get the desired shading effect.

### 6. Narrating a Purposeful Choice

Prompt: *(Tarot cards lay neatly on the desk; she picked one with purpose)*
Action and intent meld in this visual story of a girl and her tarot cards. The scene is clear: a purposeful selection amidst an organized array. Such dynamic prompts can breathe life into otherwise static images.

* Expected Image: A depiction of a girl selecting a tarot card from an organized array on a desk.
* Similar Expressions: "Girl choosing a tarot card from a tidy spread", "Tarot cards on a table with a girl purposefully selecting one".
* Alternative Expressions: "Desk with tarot cards and a girl making a choice", "Purposeful selection of a tarot card by a girl from a neat layout".
* Considerations: "Purposefully" might not be visually represented, so focus on the action (picking a card) and setting (neatly laid out cards).

### General Considerations:

Bing Image Creator, like other AIs, can sometimes produce unpredictable outputs. Testing variations of prompts can help achieve the desired result.
AVOID overly detailed prompts which might confuse the AI. If unsure, break down the prompts or be more general.
ALWAYS review images for any unintentional bias or inappropriate content. AIs can sometimes produce content that may be culturally or socially sensitive.
