### GPT-4o

GPT-4o is an AI model capable of understanding and generating various types of data. The key strengths of this model are as follows:

* Understanding Various Data Forms: It can simultaneously process and understand different types of data, such as text, images, and videos. This provides users with a richer and more intuitive interface.
* Real-Time Q&A: It interacts with users in real-time, offering accurate information based on the input data. This allows users to receive immediate feedback.
* Contextual Understanding and Generation: It comprehends given situations and contexts, generating appropriate responses accordingly. This greatly helps in personalizing and enhancing the user experience.

### AI Influencer Tyri

By leveraging the strengths of GPT-4o, an AI influencer can provide a new form of experience by accompanying users through exhibitions. The AI influencer can answer users' questions in real-time, provide information about the exhibited artworks, and share personal interpretations and evaluations of the pieces.

### Method of Inputting Recorded Videos into GPT-4o

The screen is divided into two sections: the left side displays the input screen or video, and the right side shows the video being processed by the AI along with a chat interface. This setup uses 5 frames for video processing.
