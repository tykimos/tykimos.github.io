## Prompt
Modify the scene to show the beautiful programmer now wearing glasses, enhancing her focused and professional demeanor as she works on her laptop at night. Change her attire to a developer-themed T-shirt, reflecting her identity and passion for programming. Her long golden blonde hair remains styled attractively, and the setting continues to be her home workspace, illuminated by the soft glow of the laptop screen. This adjustment aims to capture her as a quintessential programmer, combining her refined beauty with the practicality of her profession. The vibrant and dynamic webtoon with semi-realistic style highlights her dedication and expertise in programming, set against the quiet of the night.
